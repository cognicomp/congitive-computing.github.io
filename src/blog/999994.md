We love our cats. But sometimes we think that they are little monsters! They run away when you try to catch
them for their medicine and they play with their toys in the middle of the night, keeping us awake. And then
there are those times when they don't even seem to recognize us or show any affection for us at all. It may
feel like your cat is being mean, but maybe she's not trying to be mean.

## Is Your Cat Nice?

In many cases, cats aren't trying to be mean; they're just acting on instinct. Here are some ways that you can
tell if your cat is being nice or mean:

- Does she run away when you try to pet her? Cats who are scared or anxious will often run away from people
who try to touch them. This doesn't necessarily mean that they're being mean; it just means that they aren't
comfortable with being touched by strangers (or even familiar faces). If this happens regularly, it might be
best for both of you if she stays indoors full-time rather than roaming around outside where there are many
dangers such as cars and other animals who might not be friendly towards her either!

## What You Need to Know About Cats Being Nice or Mean

The cat's body language is a great way to tell whether your kitty is being nice or mean. When cats are happy,
they will often rub against your leg with their head down and tail up in the air (this is called "bunting").
They may also purr loudly or meow at you when they want attention from you.

If your cat seems angry or aggressive towards something else (like another animal), then it's probably because
she thinks her life could be threatened by that thing! In this case, she might try to attack whatever is
bothering her by swatting at it with her paws or biting if necessary. If she does bite someone who has done
nothing wrong but happened upon her territory without warning first, then we have some bad news: cats don't
understand why people need personal space either!

## Is Your Cat Nice? Here’s What You Need to Know About Cats Being Nice or Mean

### 1. The cat's body language is a great way to tell whether your kitty is being nice or mean.

The cat's body language is a great way to tell whether your kitty is being nice or mean. If you see the
following behaviors, it means that your cat is being nice and wants to play with you:

- She purrs loudly when she sees you. This can be done by either rubbing her face against yours or by making
short "meows" at you while looking directly into your eyes (this last one is called "eye contact"). The reason
why cats make eye contact with humans is because they want to show them that they love them and are happy
about being around them!

- She rubs her face against yours when she sees you coming towards her. This shows affection for whoever it
was who walked into the room before she did—and probably also makes sure that person knows she's there too
(since cats like having their space).

### 2. When cats are happy, they will often rub against your leg with their head down and tail up in the air.

- Rubbing against your leg: Cats love to be petted, so if you see them doing this it means that they're
feeling happy and content. They may also meow at you when they want attention from you! If they do bite
someone who has done nothing wrong but happened upon their territory without warning first, then we have some
bad news: cats don’t understand why people need personal space either!

- Bunting: This is the term for when a cat rubs against something with its head down and tail up in the air
(or vice versa). It could be anything from another animal to an object like a door frame or even just some
grass on the ground—as long as it's not moving around too much while being bunted upon by our feline friends!

### 3. Cats may also purr loudly or meow at you when they want attention from you.

If your cat wants to play with you, she will often purr loudly and meow at you. This is a sign that she wants
to spend time with you and get some attention from you. She might even rub against your leg or tail up in the
air as well! If she does bite someone who has done nothing wrong but happened upon her territory without
warning first, then we have some bad news: cats don't understand why people need personal space either!

### 4. If your cat seems angry or aggressive towards something else (like another animal), then it’s probably
because she thinks her life could be threatened by that thing!

- Cats are naturally territorial creatures and will defend their home against any perceived threat to it.
- If you have more than one pet, they may fight over resources such as food or water bowls in the house (and
sometimes even each other). This is especially true if one of them has been fed by hand while another ha
not—which can cause resentment between both animals!
- The best way to avoid this problem is by giving both pets equal amounts of attention and treats so that
neither feels neglected or deprived when compared with its companion(s).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, it is important to remember that cats are not nice or mean. They’re just cats! We need to
understand their behavior and learn from them. It's easy for us humans to get frustrated by our pets but we
have so much more than they do in terms of understanding what makes us tick and why certain things make sense
(and others don't). So when your kitty does something unexpected, try not getting mad at her because she
probably doesn't understand why either!

If you think about it: if a cat could talk then there would be no such thing as “crazy cat lady” syndrome.
Because no one would ever say something like "that person has too many cats" because they're all just cats
being themselves :)
