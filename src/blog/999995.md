Materials Needed:
- ClearSafe Fire Escape
- Drill
- Screws
- Level
- Tape measure

1. Choose the Window: The first step is to choose the window where you want to install the fire escape. It should be easily accessible and lead to a safe area outside.

2. Measure the Window: Measure the width and height of the window to ensure the fire escape will fit. The ClearSafe Fire Escape is adjustable, but you need to make sure it will fit within the window frame.

3. Position the Fire Escape: Position the fire escape in the window frame. Make sure it is level and centered in the window.

4. Mark the Screw Holes: Once the fire escape is positioned correctly, mark the screw holes on the window frame. This is where you will drill holes to secure the fire escape.

5. Drill the Holes: Using a drill, make holes where you marked on the window frame. Be careful not to drill too deep or you could damage the window.

6. Attach the Fire Escape: Line up the holes in the fire escape with the holes you drilled in the window frame. Use screws to secure the fire escape to the window frame. Make sure all screws are tight and the fire escape is secure.

7. Test the Fire Escape: After the fire escape is installed, it's important to test it to make sure it works properly. Open the fire escape and make sure it extends and retracts smoothly. 

8. Train Family Members: Once the fire escape is installed and tested, make sure all family members know how to use it in case of an emergency. 

Remember, a fire escape is a crucial part of home safety. Regularly check and maintain your ClearSafe Fire Escape to ensure it's always ready for use.
