 # 10 Ways to Be a Better Fashion Blogger

February 25, 2014 in Inspiration by Sophie - University of Chicago

Are you a fashion blogger? Are you interested in becoming one? Well, whether or not you’re a veteran fashion blogger or you’re just starting out, here are 10 tips for you!

### 1. Make Yourself Stand Out From the Crowd

The fashion blogging community is already jam-packed with blogs that feature street style photos and outfit posts – what can YOU do to make yours different from all of the other ones? Here are some ideas:

- Don’t be afraid to show your face! It’s hard to have a recognizable brand if you never let people see your face.
- Develop a sense of humor – or a signature look, or an aesthetic that is unique to you and your blog.
- Use other platforms in addition to your blog: Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.
- Be friendly! Make friends with the people who already run popular blogs, and go out of your way to make new connections. It’s easier to stand out if there are a lot of people who know about you.

### 2. Don’t be Afraid to Show Your Personality in Your Photos

If you don’t like smiling, don’t smile. If you’d rather laugh than pose, laugh! The more genuine you can be in your photos, the better.

### 3. Be Creative with Your Posts

This one is similar to #1, but it doesn’t always have to do with making your blog different from other blogs. Sometimes it just means thinking about what kind of posts you can create that are interesting and fun. For example:

- How-tos!
- Tips & tricks!
- Lists of things!
- Your own style inspiration!
- Anything else you can think of!

### 4. Don’t be Afraid to Make Mistakes

You will make mistakes, especially at the beginning, but don’t let that stop you from putting yourself out there and creating content. Mistakes are part of the process of getting better!

### 5. Use Good Lighting

Good lighting is one of the most important things to keep in mind if you want your photos to look professional and polished. Natural light, preferably indirect sunlight (i.e. early morning or late afternoon) will make your skin tone look more even and will help prevent shadows under your eyes. You can also use an external flash, but it’s important that the flash is facing away from you so that no harsh shadows are cast on your face.

### 6. Use a Tripod to Take Selfies

If you want to take selfies without having someone else take them for you, then using a tripod will be your best friend! It’s also much easier than trying to balance your camera on something unstable like a stack of books or leaning against the wall. All you have to do is set up your tripod in front of whatever background you want (a wall works great), position yourself where you want to be, and then take as many selfies as you like!

### 7. Use a Wide-Angle Lens for Selfies

If possible, use an SLR camera with interchangeable lenses so that you can change lenses depending on what kind of selfie look you’re going for. A wide-angle lens will give you more room in your frame and allow for more background detail which is perfect if you want a landscape or cityscape photo behind you!

### 8. Use Editing Software to Add Filters or Effects

Editing software like Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom can be used to add filters or effects to any selfie photos that need some extra help. This is great if there are blemishes on your skin that need hiding, if the lighting isn’t perfect, or if you just want a different look entirely!

### 9. Use an App Like Instagram

If editing software isn’t something that interests you then apps like Instagram are perfect for taking and sharing selfies because they have built-in filters which can be applied with one tap! You can also share your selfie photos on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms so everyone knows how awesome your life is.

### 10. Find Your Best Lighting

The best lighting for taking flattering selfies comes from indirect sunlight because it makes your skin tone look more even and will help prevent shadows under the eyes. You should also avoid using flash because it tends to wash out colors in photos making them appear duller than they really are! If possible use natural light instead of artificial lighting like lamps or overhead lights because they cast harsh shadows across faces which aren’t flattering at all!

### 11. Use a Tripod and Remote Shutter Release for Clear Photos

If you have trouble keeping your arms steady when taking selfies then consider using a tripod with remote shutter release so that there isn’t any blurriness in the picture due to camera shake or motion blur! This is especially helpful if you’re taking photos outdoors where there may be wind blowing around leaves on trees, bushes, etc., which could cause movement while trying to take a selfie.

### 12. Use Props for Fun Selfies

Props can make any boring selfie photo into something fun and interesting! Props include things like hats, glasses, scarves, sunglasses, etc., and they’re perfect for adding personality to your photos because props allow you express who YOU are as an individual instead of just being another face in a crowd.

### 13. Take Selfies with Friends or Family Members

Taking selfies with friends or family members is also fun because it allows everyone else to see how much fun you’re having together! It also helps create memories that will last long after the moment has passed by capturing those moments on film so that they can be shared with others later down the road when reminiscing about old times together.

### 14. Take Selfies While Doing Something Fun or Interesting

If you’re doing something fun or interesting, then consider taking a selfie while doing it! This could include things like dancing, singing karaoke, playing instruments, cooking dinner for your family, etc., and these types of photos are great for sharing on social media because they show what type of person YOU really are.

### 15. Take Selfies That Show Your Personality

Selfies that show YOUR personality are also fun to take because they allow others to get a glimpse into who YOU really are as an individual! These types of photos include things like wearing silly hats or costumes, taking selfies with your pets (or even just holding them up in front of the camera), doing weird facial expressions, etc., and these types of photos can be shared on social media with friends and family members so they get to see what type of person YOU really are!

### 16. Take Selfies When You’re Feeling Happy or Excited About Something

If you’re feeling happy or excited about something, then consider taking a selfie while doing it! This could include things like celebrating a birthday party for yourself or someone else, getting engaged (or even married), winning an award at work or school, etc., and these types of photos are great for sharing on social media because they show what type of person YOU really are.

### 17. Take Selfies When You’re Having Fun With Your Friends and Family Members

If you’re having fun with your friends and family members, then consider taking a selfie while doing it! This could include things like going out to eat together at restaurants (or even just eating snacks in front of the camera), going bowling together as a group (or even just bowling alone), watching movies together in bed (or even just cuddling up on the couch together), etc., and these types of photos are great for sharing on social media because they show what type of person YOU really are.

### 18. Take Selfies When You’re Doing Something Cute or Funny Together With Your Friends and Family Members

If you’re doing something cute or funny together with your friends and family members, then consider taking a selfie while doing it! This could include things like dancing around in front of the camera (or even just standing there smiling), singing songs together at karaoke (or even just singing along to music together), playing games together (or even just talking about things together), etc., and these types of photos are great for sharing on social media because they show what type of person YOU really are.

## Conclusion

Taking selfies with your friends is a fun way to capture memories, but it can be difficult to take the perfect picture every time. Here are some tips that will help you get the best shots possible:

- Make sure there’s enough light in the room where you’re taking photos. If not, use flash or turn on lights around the room so that everyone looks good in their pictures!
- Get everyone into position before taking any pictures—this way they won’t have to move around too much while posing for a shot! This will also help keep everyone looking natural instead of staged/posed (which can look unnatural).
- Make sure no one is blocking anyone else in their shots! You don’t want one person’s face to be cut off by someone else standing in front of them.
- Find a spot where there aren’t any distractions around—this means no clutter, furniture or other people in the background. If possible, choose an area with natural light coming from behind you so that everyone looks nice and evenly lit when taking photos together.
