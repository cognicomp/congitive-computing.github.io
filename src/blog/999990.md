 # 70% of patients prefer telemedicine over in-office visits

Telehealth services are becoming more popular than ever, as the COVID-19 pandemic forces people to stay home and avoid doctors’ offices. More than 70 percent of patients want to keep using telehealth even after the coronavirus crisis is over, according to a survey from Luma Health.

“I think we were all surprised at how much the industry has adapted,” said Paul A. Grundy Jr., MD, MPH, executive director of IBM Watson Health’s Institute for Medicine and former medical director of IBM Watson Health’s population health business unit. “The telehealth industry is growing by leaps and bounds.”

The number of telemedicine visits has grown by 50 percent since the beginning of the pandemic in the U.S., Grundy said. The growth has been so rapid that the telehealth industry is expected to reach $250 billion globally by 2027, according to a report from Transparency Market Research.

The telehealth trend is happening not just with patients but also with providers, Grundy added. Doctors are increasingly turning to telemedicine to interact with their patients in real time and offer remote patient monitoring services. “Providers are looking for ways to do things differently,” he said. “They’re trying to figure out how to use technology to help them get through this pandemic.”

“Telemedicine allows you to have a higher quality of service at the same time as keeping patients safe from exposure during this pandemic,” added Grundy, who is also an executive editor of The Lancet Regional Health Americas. “I think telehealth will become even more important after the COVID-19 crisis passes.”

Telemedicine can help reduce patient anxiety about going to a doctor’s office, which could lead to lower rates of depression and fewer ER visits during this pandemic, according to Grundy. It also offers greater convenience for patients who are worried about being exposed to the virus when they visit their local healthcare provider.

A 2017 survey from Luma Health showed that 73% of people would prefer to use telemedicine if it was available. “This pandemic has shown us the importance of having technology in place that allows patients to stay at home and get care when they need it,” said Grundy.

Telemedicine also offers greater convenience for doctors who can see more patients from their office or home instead of making house calls, which saves time on travel and reduces costs associated with gas and parking fees, according to Grundy. “It allows you to have a higher quality of service at the same time as keeping patients safe from exposure during this pandemic,” he said.

## The benefits of telemedicine for doctors and patients

The benefits of telemedicine include:

- Fewer hospital visits, which can save time and money on travel costs;
- A more efficient use of time, because you don’t need to drive all over town to see different specialists;
- Better access to specialists who may not be available in your area; and
- The ability to communicate with doctors using video or audio technology that doesn’t require face-to-face contact.

## Telemedicine is a way for patients to connect with their doctors without having to go into an office setting.

Telemedicine allows patients to connect with their doctors without having to go into an office setting. It can be used in situations where there are no nearby medical facilities, or when it’s difficult for patients and providers alike (due to distance or time zone differences). Telehealth also has benefits for both doctors and patients:

- For doctors, telemedicine can help them reach more people who need care; they don’t have as much paperwork because everything happens digitally instead of on paper; plus there aren’t any travel expenses associated with seeing patients face-to-face.
- For patients themselves, they get access to quality medical care without having to worry about whether or not their insurance will cover the cost of treatment at another facility if they live far away from where they receive regular checkups/visits etcetera.

## Telemedicine can help reduce patient anxiety by allowing them to connect with a doctor in the comfort of their own home, which may make it easier for them to ask questions and communicate about their health.

Patients are more likely to be honest when communicating about their symptoms if they are not physically present at an appointment. This means that doctors will have access to information that would otherwise go unnoticed by patients who are uncomfortable talking about personal issues in person or over the phone. Telemedicine also allows for more thorough follow-up care because it is easier for doctors to keep track of what has been said during previous visits via email or chat rooms rather than trying remember everything from memory alone each time a new patient comes into their office space.

## Conclusion

Telehealth can be a great way for patients to connect with doctors and other health professionals in the comfort of their own home. It’s also an excellent option for those who live far away from medical centers or are unable to travel due to physical limitations such as mobility issues, chronic pain or illness, or lack of transportation options available nearby (such as public transportation). Telehealth allows patients to access care from anywhere they have access to the internet—making it easy and convenient!
