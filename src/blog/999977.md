 # 5 Steps to Prevent Identity Theft

You probably have heard the horror stories of people losing their identities through identity theft. It is a scary thought, isn't it? You may be wondering if you can really protect yourself from this happening to you. In today’s digital age it is very easy for your identity to be stolen. There are plenty of online criminals looking to steal your personal information and use it for their own purposes. It is important that you take the necessary steps to prevent identity theft. Here are five steps to help you protect yourself.

## 1. Shred All Documents Containing Your Personal Information

Identity thieves will scour through your trash looking for information they can use against you. You need to shred any documents containing personal information like account numbers, bank statements or other financial information before throwing them away.

## 2. Guard Your Social Security Number

It is a good idea to keep your social security number in a safe place so no one has access to it. If someone needs this number, make sure they are a trusted source and don't give it out just because the person asks for it.

## 3. Don’t Give Out Personal Information Online

Don't share personal information on social networking sites. Be careful about what you post. Don't reveal your address, phone number or where you work in your posts. These are all easy ways to steal your identity and commit crimes in your name.

## 4. Protect Your Computer

Make sure to keep your computer safe from any online attacks by using antivirus software. You should also make sure to update the software regularly so it can protect you from new viruses that may appear over time. Don't open emails with attachments from unknown senders, since this could contain spyware or malware used for identity theft purposes.

## 5. Check Your Credit Reports Regularly

You should check your credit report once a year to see if there are any signs of fraudulent activity on it. If you find something suspicious, contact the credit bureau immediately and have them remove it from your file so no one else can use that information against you in the future.

If you take these simple steps, you will be well on your way to preventing identity theft and keeping your personal information safe. Identity theft is a serious problem and can cause a lot of trouble if you are not careful about protecting yourself from it.
