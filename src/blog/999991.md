 # 5193600 - Cisco ASR 9000 Series Routers

Cisco ASR 9000 series routers are a new family of service provider edge routers that build on the success and field-proven leadership of the Cisco® 7600 Series Edge Services Routers (ESRs) and Cisco 12000 Series Internet Router. They provide the industry's leading high density of Layer 2/3 Gigabit Ethernet ports, with integrated hardware and software capabilities to address service provider edge applications such as broadband access aggregation, mobile backhaul, business customer VPN services, and cloud computing connectivity. These routers also offer a modular architecture that supports both 10GE and OTN interfaces in a single line card.

## Overview:

Cisco ASR 9000 series routers are the first Cisco service provider edge router platform based on Cisco IOS® XR operating system software. This new generation of Cisco edge routers will take advantage of the same Cisco IOS XR architecture as the Cisco 7601-X and the Cisco 7603-X, but with significantly higher throughput per slot capability. Cisco IOS XR operating system software is a proven service provider operating system that provides highly scalable and reliable network services for both metro and core networks.

The Cisco ASR 9000 family of routers will help service providers provide new revenue-generating services faster, with reduced cost and complexity. These routers will build on the success and field-proven leadership of the Cisco 7600 Series ESRs and Cisco 12000 Series Internet Router (CIR) to deliver a scalable modular architecture that can grow in capacity through software license activations, providing significant cost savings over competing routers. This modularity also allows service providers to selectively add advanced capabilities when they are needed for new revenue-generating services.

The Cisco ASR 9000 series will support the following features:

- Flexible and scalable architecture that is based on the proven success of Cisco IOS XR operating system software
- High throughput, with more than 140 Gbps of aggregated data plane capacity per slot in a 1.2 kW power envelope
- Modular design that can grow in capacity through software license activations
- Integrates seamlessly with the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers and Cisco 7600 Series ESRs for complete network convergence
- Dual active/active line card support, which ensures nonstop forwarding
- Enhanced traffic engineering capabilities
- Extended multicast support in the data plane
