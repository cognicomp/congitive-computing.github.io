 # 806 Health Tip: What Your Stool Tells You About Your Gut

Well, this is going to be a fun blog. I am going to talk about your poop and what it means for you. There are different things that can make up your poop. So let's go over some of them.

1. Red - This may mean something is bleeding in the upper part of your GI tract. It could be a result from a stomach ulcer or cancer. You should get it checked out by your doctor ASAP.
2. Bright Green - This one usually means that you have taken some food supplements or colored dyes. The other reason for this is your food may not be digesting properly.
3. Yellow Grease-like - A yellow grease like poop can mean a few things. It could mean something is wrong with your gallbladder or liver. It could also be the result of taking certain medication. Make sure you tell your doctor about this one.
4. White - This means that there is not any bile in your stool. Bile makes your stool brown. The main cause for white poop is a problem with your gallbladder or pancreas.
5. Black - Black poop means it could be blood from the upper GI tract. It can also mean that you have eaten some iron supplements.
6. Mucus - This is not a good thing. You want to get this checked out by your doctor if it becomes frequent.
