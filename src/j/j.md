 # J
 
 J is the tenth letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. Its normal name in English is jay or, now uncommonly, jy. In some contexts, it may be referred to as a "jaybird". This seems to be a slight misunderstanding. The tenth letter of the modern English alphabet is actually "J", not "JJ". "JJ" is not a recognized letter in the English alphabet. The name of the letter "J" is indeed often pronounced like "jay", and in some dialects or older forms of English, it may have been pronounced as "jy". The term "jaybird" is not typically used to refer to the letter "J", but is rather a common name for several species of birds in the family Corvidae, which includes crows, ravens, and jays. The letter "J" is used in many words in the English language, such as "jump", "joke", "joy", and "justice". It is also used in names, like "John", "Jennifer", "James", and "Jessica". In terms of pronunciation, the letter "J" usually makes a sound similar to the "g" in "giant", although in some words borrowed from other languages, it can have different sounds. For example, in words borrowed from Spanish, "J" is often pronounced like the "h" in "house", as in "jalapeno" or "Jose".

In the English language, "J" is the only letter that does not appear in the periodic table of elements. It is also the least used letter in English texts. Despite its relative rarity, "J" is a very important letter in the English language, and its unique sound contributes greatly to the richness and diversity of English pronunciation.

In terms of its history, the letter "J" is a relatively late addition to the English alphabet. It was originally a variant of the letter "I", and was not consistently distinguished from "I" until the 17th century. The letter "J" was first used to represent the sound we now associate with it in the year 1524 by the Italian grammarian Gian Giorgio Trissino. Prior to this, the letter "J" was often used interchangeably with "I" in writing, and its pronunciation varied. 

In the English language, the letter "J" is often used to start adjectives and adverbs, such as "joyful", "jubilant", "justly", and "jovially". It is also used in many common nouns, such as "job", "jacket", "jewel", and "journey". In addition, "J" is used in many verbs, such as "jump", "jog", "juggle", and "judge". 

In terms of its appearance, the letter "J" is one of the few letters in the English alphabet that has a distinct upper case and lower case form. The upper case "J" is usually written as a vertical line with a curve at the bottom, while the lower case "j" is usually written as a vertical line with a dot above it and a curve at the bottom. 

In conclusion, while "J" may be one of the least used letters in the English language, it is a vital part of the alphabet. Its unique sound and usage in a variety of words and names add to the richness and diversity of the English language. Despite its late addition to the alphabet and its relatively low frequency of use, the letter "J" has a significant impact on English pronunciation and spelling.
