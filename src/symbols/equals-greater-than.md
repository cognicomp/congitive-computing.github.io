This symbol is often used in mathematics and computer programming to denote implication or the action of moving forward. It can also be used to indicate a range or progression. For example, in a sequence of numbers or steps, it can be used to show the transition from one step to the next. In mathematics, the symbol is used to denote a logical implication. For example, if A => B, it means that if A is true, then B must also be true. 

In computer programming, the symbol is often used in conditional statements. For example, in the programming language Python, the symbol => is not used, but the equivalent would be the symbol == in an if statement. 

In the context of a range or progression, the symbol can be used to indicate a transition from one value to another. For example, in the sequence 1 => 2 => 3, it shows a progression from 1 to 2 to 3. 

In general, the symbol => is used to indicate a forward movement or progression from one state to another.
