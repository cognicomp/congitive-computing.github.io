The term "sling" in the context of construction refers to a type of lifting device used to lift, move, or support loads. Slings are typically made of materials like wire rope, chain, or synthetic materials and are used in conjunction with a lifting device, such as a crane or hoist. They are designed to evenly distribute the weight of the load, making it easier and safer to move heavy objects. Slings come in various types and designs, each suited for specific applications. For instance, chain slings are often used for heavy-duty lifting tasks due to their strength and durability, while synthetic slings are preferred for their flexibility and gentleness on delicate loads.

The use of slings in construction is governed by safety regulations to prevent accidents and injuries. These regulations stipulate the proper use, inspection, and maintenance of slings. For example, slings should be regularly inspected for any signs of wear and tear, and any damaged sling should be immediately removed from service.

In addition to lifting, slings can also be used for anchoring and pulling applications. They are an essential tool in many construction projects, enabling workers to handle heavy materials safely and efficiently.

The term "sling" in the context of a cocktail refers to a type of mixed drink that typically includes spirits, water, sweetener, and sometimes bitters. The most famous example of a sling cocktail is the Singapore Sling, which includes gin, cherry liqueur, Cointreau, Benedictine, grenadine, pineapple juice, fresh lime juice, and a dash of bitters. The term "sling" originally referred to a North American drink composed of spirit and water, sweetened and flavored.
